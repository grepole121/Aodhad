An incomplete video hosting website I made around 2011/2012. 

Uses HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL. 

It does also use Javascript but I did not write the Javascript code.

Below are some screenshots of the website. This is not the full extent of the website as there have been many updates to packages used so it no longer works with the database. As such the login/register no longer works and by extension that means you cannot access the upload. The search function also used a database so this no longer works either.
